# Our Space — Build Report

Updated: 2026-10-23 (Asia/Saigon). This report records implementation evidence, not product acceptance.

## Workspace and authority

- Workspace: `D:/MinhQuun/Tmp/OurSpace`.
- Repository: `https://github.com/MinhQuun/OurSpace`, PUBLIC expressly approved by Product Owner.
- Branch: `codex/ourspace-build`; base commit `ae050dfd8e8cafb0cbb4670269fef58999cb8dbe`.
- Existing uncommitted Goal V1.1 additions retained; PUBLIC amendment supersedes private-repository gates only. Application Authentication/Authorization requirements remain.
- No production, billing, cloud account secrets, force push, history rewrite, or merge authorized/performed.

## Task 00.1 — Public repository and source audit baseline

Acceptance: preserve existing files; correct Goal repository policy; ignore local secrets/build/data; inspect tracked history without printing secret values; verify 11 approved source checksums against embedded master; inventory draft CSVs. No product AC claimed by this tooling task.

- `scripts/verify_sources.py`: PASS, 11 source SHA-256 and byte lengths (canonical LF), embedded master bodies match extracted sources; draft inventories contain 247 Dxx and 763 AC.
- `scripts/audit_repository.py`: PASS heuristic scan of all 31 historical blobs, including ZIP members; no matching credential findings. This is not proof that all possible secrets/personal data are absent.
- Historical exposure risk: initial commit already tracks both handoff ZIPs, reference video and documents. Reference contact sheet visually reviewed: third-party photobook tutorial with TikTok attribution and people pictured. Full video not frame-by-frame reviewed; redistribution permission not established. No new media is staged. Existing history preserved as requested.
- `.gitignore` does not untrack historical assets; it prevents accidental addition of new archives/media, environment files, dumps, keys, uploads and build products.
- Python syntax compilation PASS; whitespace check PASS. Application lint/typecheck not applicable yet (no application or TypeScript exists); Python regression test command: `python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p test_*.py -v`.
- Commit: `69e95c4` (`chore(audit): establish public repository and source verification baseline`), LOCAL_ONLY. Five Python regression tests PASS; syntax compilation and whitespace checks PASS.
- Push: GIT_PUSH_BLOCKED. Automatic approval review rejected `git push -u origin codex/ourspace-build` before execution because reachable history includes ZIP documents and video with people whose public redistribution permission is unverified. No remote SHA verification is claimed. Explicit user clarification about the historical assets has been requested; no alternate push route or history rewrite attempted.

## Environment and open issues

- Windows PowerShell; Node 20.20.2; Python 3.11.1; Git available; npm available; Docker CLI present.
- Initial sandbox denied Git metadata writes and network. Authorized elevated `git switch -c codex/ourspace-build` succeeded; elevated `git ls-remote --heads origin` confirmed base master SHA. These two operations were approved; the later push was rejected as recorded above.
- Docker daemon access denied in sandbox; retry with suitable permissions during Stage 01 before declaring database blocked.
- OP-01 through OP-07 remain unapproved proposals. Dependent business operations must be POLICY_BLOCKED unless separately approved; independent technical work continues.
- Next: build machine-readable requirement registry with source references and explicit UNMAPPED priority/test evidence. Read BRD sections per stage; source verification is not a claim that all 763 AC have been analyzed or implemented.
- Historical push blocker resolved: Product Owner explicitly confirmed the documents/media in base commit `ae050df` may be public and contain no sensitive personal material requiring secrecy. Approval review accepted the subsequent push. Remote `codex/ourspace-build` SHA verified as `4b1ac04e45342477738fb0bfbb31c690a2e00ff3`; both `69e95c4` and `4b1ac04` are PUSHED. No history rewrite performed.

## Task 00.2 — Machine-readable source registry

Acceptance: inventory all approved decisions/AC/policies and supporting draft families/E2E; validate original line references; preserve source authority; leave unsupported mappings and priorities UNMAPPED; never infer PASS from inventory counts.

- `scripts/build_registry.py` builds `requirements/registry.json` reproducibly from checksum-verified sources: 247 decisions, 763 AC, 86 draft P0 families, 40 draft E2E, 7 approved DEC.
- All 1,010 BRD decision/AC source line locators validated against original identifiers. The 60 decisions without explicit AC mapping remain UNMAPPED; remaining mappings are draft references requiring review.
- Registry contains source, module, owner, priority, test and status; all implementation states NOT_IMPLEMENTED, tests empty, desktop/mobile NOT_RUN. AC priority remains UNMAPPED pending actual BRD scope analysis. Cross-module owner is deliberately CROSS_MODULE until technical ownership is resolved.
- Validation: 8 Python tests PASS, including reproducibility, missing mappings and no false acceptance. Application lint/typecheck not applicable to this Python inventory task; Python syntax and Git whitespace gates run before commit.
- Commit/push pending for this task. Next: Stage 01 skeleton only after verified push.
